<h1>Macbeth</h1>
<p>
Macbeth is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare in 1606. It is considered one of Shakespeare's most topical plays. It has the theme of Greed and Power in it, in which the main character of the play, Macbeth, gets too greedy and powerful which ends up contributing to his downfall.
</p>
<p>
In the beginning of the play, Macbeth and his best friend, Banquo, get a prediction from the Weird Sisters. They say Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor, and eventually even King of Scotland, but Banquo will have his descendants become kings. Macbeth does get the title of Thane of Cawdor, but when he goes to King Duncan to find out who his heir is, it is Malcolm, and Duncan has another son called Donalbain.
</p>
<p>
Macbeth ends up being persuaded by Lady Macbeth to kill King Duncan in order to claim the throne. He kills Duncan, blaming it on the guards, and causing Malcolm and Donalbain to flee. He now is the King of Scotland because of this.
</p>
<p>
Banquo wonders if Macbeth really was affected by the prophecy or not. Macbeth knows that Banquo’s descendants will become kings, so he tries to stop them from doing so. Banquo gets killed, but his son Fleance manages to escape.
</p>
<p>
Macbeth asks for another prophecy, in which the witches say that “None of woman born shall harm Macbeth”, “Beware Macduff”, and “You shall not be vanquished until great Birnam Wood turns against you”. Obviously, this sounds ridiculous, so Macbeth thinks it is nothing. Macbeth becomes a tyrant that does whatever he first thinks of, and Macduff and the other Thanes of Scotland come to battle Macbeth, who loses and dies.
